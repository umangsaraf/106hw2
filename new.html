        <p >Hey Boss! Hope you're having a good time on your yatch i mean work. You wanted me to
            figure out if the new impossible burger made an impact on our revenue. 
            Well the simple answer is - <b> Yes </b>   Our sales have taken a big hit since the launch of new impossible burger.</p> 
            <p>
            Lets take a look at the average revenue of each month by year. I'm computing total average monthly sales
            for each instead of sum of months since I dont have the complete data for 2019. There was a
            <b>15%</b>increase in revenue in 2017 and <b>5%</b> increase to  <b>$12.8 million</b> in 2018. But instead of
            upward trend for 2019, there was a <b>2%</b> decrease to <b>$12.1 million</b>
        </p>

    <p > Taking a look at the chart below, we see the revenue for each month increases with the year.
        For year 2016 and 2017, we notice an psoitibve facing slope from January to Decmber with a few dips
        at some months. The revenue then again decrease back again in Janauary. This can be explained by people switching to a healhier diet as a new 
        year resolution <br>
        2018 we had some dips in revenue in may and june but in oct 2018 our sales fell from 13.2 million to
        11.3 millions, a 14% drop, making it the largest drop in revenue.

        <p> Let's take a closer look on how revenue got impacted by the impossible burger. We see that
            uptil october 2018, the months have a revenue of around $13 million on avergae. When the impossible
        burger were released there was a big drop in revenue. Impossible burger just didn't affect Octobers revenue but also 
        all months after it. Revenue in all months of 2019 was lower than the revenue of those in 2018.

        <p>
            Looking at the revenue for diffrent regions after the impossible burger was released, we see 
            that all regions took a hit and their revenue went down significantly.
